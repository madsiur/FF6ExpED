##FF6ExpED
####version: 0.2


FF6ExpED is an FF3us (FF6) WPF editor that aims to expand some data of the game, manage these expansions and allow data editing.
Dropped items and stolen items can be expanded and managed. They are expanded to 4 per monster instead of 2 and the global drop chances can be edited. I won't continue working on this editor since its features will be murged with FF6AE, currently in development.

Known bugs: 

* Total percentage can sometime be 101%. This is due to how the percentages are rounded.
* Backup feature does not work as intented. Need further investigation.
* NOT A BUG: UI styling is not completed.
